# Multilingual Dictionaries

AGENTS.md already defines repo-wide i18n and safety rules. Use this focused checklist for dictionary work.

## Checklist

- Preserve dictionary shapes, keys, exported getters, and TypeScript types.
- Update every relevant locale (`ru`, `en`, `pl`, `be`, `uk`, `kk`, `uz`, `az`, `tr`, `ka`, `hy`, `fa`, `ckb`, `kmr`, `ar`, `he`, `ro`, `sr`, `sq`, `mn`) or report gaps.
- Avoid single-language literals in shared components.
- Keep insurance/legal/privacy/cookie terms natural and legally careful, not literal machine translations.
- Keep SEO copy aligned with existing SEO dictionaries/helpers.

## Verify

- Run `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Also run `npm run check:relations` when editing `calculator.ts`, `home.ts`, or `infoCompare.ts`.

## Report

Files/locales changed, missing locales, assumptions, translation/legal risks, and verification results.
